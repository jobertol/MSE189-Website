<br>
<p>
  In the United States, there are 28 million operations each year. Unfortunately,
  with surgeries come complications. Each year, there are 1,500 cases of retained
  foreign objects (RFOs) nationwide which are left in the body following surgery.
  RFOs usually result in discomfort to patients, but the complications can go so
  far as to elicit patient death. Because of this, hospitals find themselves
  face-to-face with million dollar lawsuits. To combat this, we will be expanding
  the use of radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags in an attempt to prevent
  further accounts of RFOs.
</p>

<br>

<h1>Market Need</h1>
<br>
<p>
  The current course of action for preventing RFOs is to count the tools that are
  used per surgery before and after the operation before closing up the patient.
  However, this process wastes valuable time and humans are prone to error. Our
  team has set out to create a detection method using identification tags and a
  scanner in order to reduce the time taken to prevent RFOs while simultaneously
  making this process more effective.

<br>

<h1>Our Product</h1>
<br>
<p>
  Our solution implements the use of an RFID tag tracking system which can provide
  nurses and surgeons with the reassurance of knowing that no surgical instruments
  were left behind in their patients. The tags will be ultra high frequency (UHF) to
  allow an adequate detection range of at least 3-5 meters, passive so that they are
  powered by electromagnetic energy transmitted from an RFID reader, small enough to
  fit onto all surgical instruments, and will be held with a medical grade adhesive
  capable of withstanding the sterilization procedure and the surgery itself. This
  will allow nurses to simply activate the ceiling mounted RFID reader which will
  then detect whether or not tagged instruments are present in range of the patient.
  Not only is this A.I. technology more accurate and eliminates the possibility of
  human error, but it also drastically cuts down on the time it usually takes nurses
  to count instruments by hand.

<h1>Market Potential</h1>
<br>
<p>
  The market we are targeting is vast, seeing as though our product would be a compatible
  solution to nearly any hospital which performs surgeries. Currently, there are
  approximately 6,146 hospitals in the U.S., and considering the affordability of our product,
  all of these hospitals would be able to utilize it if they choose to. By showing hospitals
  the benefits of such a device and how it can save large amounts of expenses by preventing
  RFOs from occurring and with the help of our physician mentor, Dr. Ninh Nguyen, we believe
  our RFOID tracking system will be able to make it into surgery rooms one hospital at a time.
</p>

<br>
<br>

<h1>Advantages/Differentiators</h1>
<br>
<p>
  There currently is no direct competition in this market. There is a company that uses a
  similar concept to track disposable surgical sponges, but not other surgical instruments.
  Thus, we would be the only provider of a solution which completely addresses this unmet need.
</p>

<br>
<br>

<h1>Business Model</h1>
<br>
<p>
We will sell our adhesive UHF RFID tags that can be attached to any metal surgical instrument,
such as a scalpel or pair of scissors. In addition, we will sell an overhead scanner that will
be a one time purchase. Hospitals have several sets of hundreds of surgical instruments for each
operating room and we aim to sell UHF RFID tags that will be used for every instrument in thousands
of hospitals worldwide. Additionally, profit can be made from the sale of the overhead detection
systems. This will be done through an online retailer. In the Medicare cost report data for 2014,
hospitals spent about $10 billion on medical supplies, such as handheld surgical instruments. Since
all metal surgical instruments can be tagged, there is an enormous market potential. <br>
In order to reach our customers, we will advertise to spread awareness as well as rely on word of
mouth to provide our customers with our products. In our early implementation stage, we will provide
free trials of our products to generate more awareness of our company. Hospitals will be able to opt
in to purchasing our products when they are purchasing their surgical instruments and tools. We
predict that once implemented, the cost of RFID tags on surgical instruments will even out to
about $10 per operation, making the cost a worthwhile investment considering the time saved in
every operation, time saved in corrective surgeries, and potential lawsuits.
