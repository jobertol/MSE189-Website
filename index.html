          <h1 id="What is RFOID">What is RFOID?</h1>
          <br>
          <p>We’ve designed a device for hospitals to use which eliminates the risk of surgical instruments being left
            inside patients. The issue of retained foreign objects or RFOs won't even cross most people's minds, but tools
            are left in thousands of patients each year.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Our technology utilizes easy to apply stickers and an overhead
            device that can scan a patient for tools at the press of a button. One sticker is applied to each surgical
            instrument via a biocompatible adhesive which is waterproof and safe for any sterilization process.
            The tags are passive, meaning that they won't need replacement or any battery changes. The overhead scanner
            detects the stickers using ultra high frequency RFID technology and cuts the time needed to check the patient
            for tools down from several minutes to just around one second.
          </p>

          <br>
          <p>
            In the United States, there are 28 million operations each year. Unfortunately,
            with surgeries come complications. Each year, there are 1,500 cases of retained
            foreign objects (RFOs) nationwide which are left in the body following surgery.
            RFOs usually result in discomfort to patients, but the complications can go so
            far as to elicit patient death. Because of this, hospitals find themselves
            face-to-face with million dollar lawsuits. To combat this, we will be expanding
            the use of radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags in an attempt to prevent
            further accounts of RFOs.
          </p>

          <h1 id="Market Need">Market Need</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            The current course of action for preventing RFOs is to count the tools that are
            used per surgery before and after the operation before closing up the patient.
            However, this process wastes valuable time and humans are prone to error. Our
            team has set out to create a detection method using identification tags and a
            scanner in order to reduce the time taken to prevent RFOs while simultaneously
            making this process more effective.
          </p>

          <br>
          <p>
            Our solution implements the use of an RFID tag tracking system which can provide
            nurses and surgeons with the reassurance of knowing that no surgical instruments
            were left behind in their patients. The tags will be ultra high frequency (UHF) to
            allow an adequate detection range of at least 3-5 meters, passive so that they are
            powered by electromagnetic energy transmitted from an RFID reader, small enough to
            fit onto all surgical instruments, and will be held with a medical grade adhesive
            capable of withstanding the sterilization procedure and the surgery itself. This
            will allow nurses to simply activate the ceiling mounted RFID reader which will
            then detect whether or not tagged instruments are present in range of the patient.
            Not only is this A.I. technology more accurate and eliminates the possibility of
            human error, but it also drastically cuts down on the time it usually takes nurses
            to count instruments by hand.

            The market we are targeting is vast, seeing as though our product would be a compatible
            solution to nearly any hospital which performs surgeries. Currently, there are
            approximately 6,146 hospitals in the U.S., and considering the affordability of our product,
            all of these hospitals would be able to utilize it if they choose to. By showing hospitals
            the benefits of such a device and how it can save large amounts of expenses by preventing
            RFOs from occurring and with the help of our physician mentor, Dr. Ninh Nguyen, we believe
            our RFOID tracking system will be able to make it into surgery rooms one hospital at a time.

            CensiTrac uses an inventory management system to improve operating room efficiency by linking
            surgical instruments to their respective trays which can then be linked to specific procedures
            and patients using barcodes placed on the trays of each set. This system is designed more for
            preventing surgery start time delays rather than preventing retained foreign objects in real
            time during surgery.

            Xerafy’s Surgical Instrument Tracking system uses rugged RFID tags capable of withstanding
            decontamination and sterilization processes, along with a handheld scanner to detect if
            instruments are missing from a set. The scanner is used over the tray of instruments, rather
            than the patient. Instruments can either be grouped together or listed separately in the interface.

            We will sell our adhesive UHF RFID tags that can be attached to any metal surgical instrument,
            such as a scalpel or pair of scissors. In addition, we will sell an overhead scanner that will
            be a one time purchase. Hospitals have several sets of hundreds of surgical instruments for each
            operating room and we aim to sell UHF RFID tags that will be used for every instrument in thousands
            of hospitals worldwide. Additionally, profit can be made from the sale of the overhead detection
            systems. This will be done through an online retailer. In the Medicare cost report data for 2014,
            hospitals spent about $10 billion on medical supplies, such as handheld surgical instruments. Since
            all metal surgical instruments can be tagged, there is an enormous market potential.

            In order to reach our customers, we will advertise to spread awareness as well as rely on word of
            mouth to provide our customers with our products. In our early implementation stage, we will provide
            free trials of our products to generate more awareness of our company. Hospitals will be able to opt
            in to purchasing our products when they are purchasing their surgical instruments and tools. We
            predict that once implemented, the cost of RFID tags on surgical instruments will even out to
            about $10 per operation, making the cost a worthwhile investment considering the time saved in
            every operation, time saved in corrective surgeries, and potential lawsuits.

            With the existing competition in the market, our products are set to replace the existing products.
            In order to achieve such a goal, our marketing strategy needs to help our customers with the transition
            process to our product. There are 2 main steps for our market strategies discussed below.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Free Trial / Use Training: It is important to encourage our potential customers to familiarize themselves
            with our product, which we will accomplish through free trials and trainings. The trials would help the
            tags and overhead scanner appear in hospitals across the country and the training ensure that our product
            is accessible to all potential users. Our products are easy to operate, therefore, training can be finished
            in three hours. After their free trial and training, our clients will determine if they would like to keep our
            products. With the simplicity and reliable function of the tags, we believe they would make a very appealing
            case for themselves during the free trial.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Initial Discounted Price: After clients have the ability to test our products, the next factor buyers will
            consider is the price. An initially discounted price will help us to expand our product to more markets,
            which is critical to our start-up company. The lower price is also welcomed from customers. This win-win
            situation increases the chance of them purchasing the product, and we will start to accumulate a positive
            reputation and market share from here on out.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The following marketing strategies, which will be used to further advertise our product, are summarized in
            the table below:
